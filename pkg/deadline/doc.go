// Package deadline is is a library to create deadlines for goroutines and programs.  This package is used as a safeguard to prevent a goroutine, test, or program from exhausting resources or otherwise running beyond the expected duration of time.  You can also use this library for automatically introducing some chaos into your container environment to test failover and network resilience.
